# hello-world
This is my first repository. This is exciting. Woooooo! 
To Whom this may concern:
    Im Andy, this is my GitHub. There are many GitHubs like this, but this GitHub is mine. I have no idea what I am doing. I am currently trying to learn Python. there has been many attempts at trying to learn various coding languages and so far nothing has stuck. How is this attempt different from any other attempt? well, this time I have realized i have no creativity nor do I have any reason for learning how to code. it just seems to be part of my journey and i keep fighting it. this time, I will not fight it, i surrender.  I will follow instructions and try not to get distracted.
